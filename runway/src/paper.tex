\chapter{Introduction}

This paper demonstrates all 6 status badges with colored indicator dots.
Each status corresponds to a formalization state for declarations over $\N$ and $\Z$.
For a given declaration $d$, we track whether $d$ has been formalized, whether its
proof is complete, and whether all of its dependencies are resolved.

\chapter{All Six Status Types}

\section{Not Ready (Sandy Brown)}

A node is \emph{not ready} when it has not yet been prepared for formalization.
For example, a foundational lemma about elements $n \in \N$ may require
prerequisite definitions before formalization can begin.

\section{Ready (Light Sea Green)}

A node is \emph{ready} when the proof strategy is clear and formalization can proceed.
Consider a proposition $P(n)$ for all $n \in \N$: once the dependencies are in place
and the approach is understood, the node transitions to ready status.

\section{Sorry (Dark Red)}

When a proof contains \texttt{sorry}, the node receives the sorry status automatically.
This indicates that the formalization is incomplete---for instance, a lemma
$\forall x \in \Z,\; f(x) = f(-x)$ might have a partial proof with gaps remaining.

\section{Proven (Light Green)}

A node is \emph{proven} when its proof is complete but some of its dependencies
are not yet fully resolved. For a chain of lemmas $L_1 \to L_2 \to \cdots \to L_k$
where $k \geq 2$, a node $L_i$ may be proven while $L_{i-1}$ still has sorry.

\section{Fully Proven (Forest Green)}

A node is \emph{fully proven} when both its own proof and all transitive
dependencies are complete. Given a dependency chain where each $L_i$ satisfies
$L_i : \N \to \text{Prop}$, the terminal node achieves fully proven status only
when every ancestor in the chain is also proven.

\section{Mathlib Ready (Light Blue)}

Nodes marked \emph{mathlib ready} are candidates for upstreaming to Mathlib.
These represent results of general interest, such as a theorem about
$\Z$-module homomorphisms $\varphi : \Z^n \to \Z^m$ where $n, m \in \N$.
